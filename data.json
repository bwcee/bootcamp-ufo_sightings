On or about July 1973 or 1974. Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, \"Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline\" which we did as well as most of the block. What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get  over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing  that any aircraft or helicopter could do. Not only did my family see this but was reported by was channel 8 news along with hundreds of people I will say on thing this report is not a hoax I seen other sightings as well but none as this one.","stats":"Occurred : 7/14/1973 22:00  (Entered as : 07/14/73 22:00) Reported: 4/20/2019 2:21:04 AM 02:21 Posted: 4/25/2019 Location: Dallas, TX Shape: Oval Duration:6 minutes","date_time":"7/14/73 22:00","report_link":"http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/145/S145751.html","city":"Dallas","state":"TX","shape":"Oval","duration":"6 minutes","summary":"Ufos report in Irving Texas at 2200 hrs.

It sound like a jet type engine, but not a plane.  Then a circular object came over the trees of our back yard at what I would say would be a helicopter type height, but it was not a helicopter. It didn't sound like a jet or a helicopter, but it was a jet type sound. It moved slowly in a northeast direction and hovered directly over our pool for about 5 to 10 seconds and then continued to slowly continue. When it was above we could see what looked like two jet type engines at the back of the craft facing in a downward direction then they rotated back some and it continued moving slowly until it was out of site due to the roof of our house. We were both looking in amazement and didn't think to grab my phone to video until it had almost cleared the house and you really could see anything on the video since I tried to take the video so fast. We live near Space X, which is the general direction it came from and are about 35 minutes from Ft. Hood army base.  So we thought maybe it might be an experimental craft. I am so mad at myself for not immediately grabbing my phone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he corrected the date to 2018.  He seemed to us to be quite sober-minded, and we suspect that he and his wife probably are very capable and reliable witnesses.

I rolled down my window.  It made no noise the light didn’t move this was for about 4 minutes. .  I got scared and started to drive and the light went straight up into the sky and went back north.
